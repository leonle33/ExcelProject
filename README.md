# Data Cleaning and Dashboard Creating in Excel: Bike Sales

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of bike sales to uncover patterns and insights about the demographics and characteristics of customers who purchase bikes. Using Excel, I cleaned the data and created an interactive dashboard to visualize the findings.

Utilizing Excel tools and functions, I cleaned and prepared the dataset to ensure it was accurate and ready for analysis. Using pivot tables, I created an interactive dashboard to dynamically explore the data and visualize key insights/characteristics of bike purchasers. The interactive dashboard allows us to view customer demographics, including region, income, gender, and age to identify trends in bike purchases. This is an example of how Excel could be used to help inform marketing and sales strategies of a bike company. 

This project demonstrates my proficiency in using Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. By creating an interactive dashboard, I provided a powerful tool for stakeholders to understand customer demographics and make data-driven decisions.
